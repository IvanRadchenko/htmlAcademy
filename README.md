HTML Academy Project - Course 1
A small multi page website. Building in several steps.
- Step 1 - revision of HTML, CSS. Static website with no fluid design in mind even though following BEM.
- Step 2 - migration on Webpack, modular design for js, html, scss + Refactor due to numerous step1 fails that opened up once I start thinking in a modular way (mistakes in BEM naming, leaked inheritance in few places)
- Step 3 - move to react
